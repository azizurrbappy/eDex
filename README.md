#📘 Project Overview

The Course Management Platform is a modern full-stack web application designed
to provide a smooth and intuitive experience for browsing, managing, and
creating course-based products. Built with Next.js (App Router) and NextAuth.js,
the app offers secure authentication, polished UI, and responsive layouts across
all pages. A minimal Express.js backend powers the product API, keeping the
architecture simple yet scalable.
